This web application transcribes audio files. Perfect for keeping 
meeting notes for later!
To use, first create a login and upload your .WAV audio file, then 
go to Files to view your uploaded files and choose which file to 
Transcribe.
Clicking Transcribe will detect all the speech in the audio file 
and display it as text.
You can view your previously transcribed files from the homepage.
Your audio files and transcriptions are also stored securely, so 
only you can access them.
